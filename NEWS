NEWS for Guile-PG


- version 0.12 released 2002-12-21

  - PATH/configure where PATH != "./" supported

	This is known as "vpath build" or "srcdir!=builddir build".
	Previously, "make check" failed for such situations due to not
	being able to find test/testing.scm.

  - New module: (database postgres-types)
  - New module: (database postgres-table)

	These scheme modules are documented in their respective chapters
	(for now, see code for detailed documentation on each proc).


- version 0.11 released 2002-12-17

  - InvalidOid declaration slack

	This variable is expected to be declared by libpq-fe.h (or one
	of its sub-#include files).  PostgreSQL 7.0.3, in particular,
	fails to do this, but provides `InvalidOid' in another header.
	Configuration now attempts to include the appropriate additional
	header.

  - scm_terminating declaration slack

	This variable is expected to be declared by libguile.h (or one
	of its sub-#include files).  Some versions of Guile provide
	"terminating" but not "scm_terminating".  Configuration now
	detects lack of scm_terminating and arranges (heuristically) for
	the latter to be an alias of the former.

  - New file: THANKS

	A good place to find fellow guile-pg users!


- version 0.10 released 2002-12-14

  - Bugfix: pg-lo-tell

	This procedure, which does the equivalent of "seek 0 SEEK_CUR",
	was not taking into account guile's port buffering conventions,
	resulting in an incorrect value being returned (the position
	indicated by the end of the port's read-buffer instead of the
	actual position).  For example:

	  (pg-lo-tell port)	=> 0	; ok
	  (pg-lo-read 4 2 port)         ; read two objects of four bytes
          (pg-lo-tell port)     => 100	; wrong, should be 8

	Test coverage for pg-lo-tell is still rather low.  Additional
	interesting test cases are always welcome.


- version 0.09 released 2002-12-12

	Docs spiffing: Info page organization now flattened.

	As a convenience for existing code, the vars:
		PGRES_EMPTY_QUERY
		PGRES_COMMAND_OK
		PGRES_TUPLES_OK
		PGRES_COPY_OUT
		PGRES_COPY_IN
		PGRES_BAD_RESPONSE
		PGRES_NONFATAL_ERROR
		PGRES_FATAL_ERROR
	are now added back, but w/ symbolic values rather than
	numerical.  However, this is temporary; these vars will go away
	(and stay gone) as 1.0 release nears.  New code should use
	symbols directly (see manual for examples).


- version 0.08 released 2002-12-11

	Maintenance for guile-pg has passed from Ian Grant (original
	author) to Thien-Thi Nguyen.  Thanks Ian!

	This release differs from 0.07 in that `pg-result-status' values
	are symbolic (rather than numerical), the guile-pg integrated
	interpreter is no longer included (neither built nor installed),
	the "rcsid"-related procs/vars are no longer included, and "make
	check" now works pre-install.

	See http://www.glug.org/alt/ for latest anoncvs access info.


- version 0.07 released 2000-07-08

	Released Version 0.07.  The primnary reason for this release is
	to fix a bug where 0.06 wouldn't build with the newly-released
	guile-1.4 Also added pg-oid-value function.


- version 0.06 released 2000-06-02

	Released Version 0.06.  Builds with guile-1.3.4 and pre-release
	guile-1.4.  Function names changed from pg:xxx to the more
	schemely pg-xxx.  Minor documentation and bug fixes.


- version 0.05 released 1999-06-03

	Second alpha release. Version 0.05


- version 0.04 released 1999-12-24
