NEWS for Guile-PG


- version 0.09 released 2002-12-12

	Docs spiffing: Info page organization now flattened.

	As a convenience for existing code, the vars:
		PGRES_EMPTY_QUERY
		PGRES_COMMAND_OK
		PGRES_TUPLES_OK
		PGRES_COPY_OUT
		PGRES_COPY_IN
		PGRES_BAD_RESPONSE
		PGRES_NONFATAL_ERROR
		PGRES_FATAL_ERROR
	are now added back, but w/ symbolic values rather than
	numerical.  However, this is temporary; these vars will go away
	(and stay gone) as 1.0 release nears.  New code should use
	symbols directly (see manual for examples).


- version 0.08 released 2002-12-11

	Maintenance for guile-pg has passed from Ian Grant (original
	author) to Thien-Thi Nguyen.  Thanks Ian!

	This release differs from 0.07 in that `pg-result-status' values
	are symbolic (rather than numerical), the guile-pg integrated
	interpreter is no longer included (neither built nor installed),
	the "rcsid"-related procs/vars are no longer included, and "make
	check" now works pre-install.

	See http://www.glug.org/alt/ for latest anoncvs access info.
