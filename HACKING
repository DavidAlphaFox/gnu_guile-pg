Please read the GNU Coding Standards. I have tried to conform to these.
If there are any violations of them then please tell me.

One exception is the provision of non-ANSI function prototypes, which
Guile doesn't do. Since you can't build a working Guile without an ANSI
C compiler it's no great problem that you can't build guile-pg either.

This module uses aclocal, automake, autoconf and libtool. I've used automake
version 1.4, autoconf version 2.13. The libtool version is 1.3.2

If you add a file remember to make sure it's included in the distribution
automatically (because it's a standard file like README or it's an
explicitly listed dependency) or put it in the EXTRA_DIST list.

After changing any Makefile.am or the m4 macros in acinclude.m4, run

     aclocal && automake && autoconf

or use the ./autogen.sh which is in the build tree.

When adding to any Makefile.am use $(srcdir) and check that the build can
still be done in a directory other than top-level source directory.

Please add test cases to the tests in the test directory, and run 'make check'
to test them.

The `dist' and `distcheck' targets are supremeley useful. To use distcheck
though you need to make sure that the shared libguile is on the load path
because distcheck runs the tests. If libguile.so is on the load path
anyway then this is no problem, but if it's not you can use the loader's
load path environment variable. On Linux, SunOS etc you can say

       LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/guile/lib make distcheck

Of course the Postgres server must be running when you do this.
